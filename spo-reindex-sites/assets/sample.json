    "longDescription": ["The script should **ONLY** be used for the scenario where a schema mapping affects ALL content in your tenant. Site re-indexing may add stress to the search system and take an extended amount of time to complete. Re-crawls of sites with more than one million items can potentially take weeks to process. Subsequent index updates could be delayed until the re-indexing is complete, leading to out-of-date search results. Make sure to only initiate a site re-index after making changes that require all items to be reindexed."],
